  * Performed a thorough literature survey on the existing work in Online Convex Optimization (OCO).
  * Designed a No constraint violation algorithm with theoretical guarantees for sublinear dynamic regret for the OCO problem.
  * Extended the algorithm to the distributed setting by imposing an extended Slater’s condition to establish strong duality for feasible optimization. Pending some experiments, planning to submit the work soon.

  * Worked on isolation devices across Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, and Maxim, among others, to find and improve upon specifications which are not part of the standard datasheet, but may be critical in certain scenarios.
  * The knowledge of these specifications of the devices will be used to aid product definitions and in improving marketing strategies. It will also help in the better analysis and addressing of customer’s issues.
  * Performed many device and system level tests, including CMTI, Surge, ESD, EFT, etc., tests. Learned about the working and applications of isolators, RS485, CAN and I2C protocols.
