title: "Conceptual motivation of MCMC using Hamiltonian Dynamics"
summary: "Provided a comprehensive conceptual account of the theoretical foundations of
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Focused on developing a principled intuition behind the HMC method and its optimal
implementations. The discussion also included some of the popular extensions to
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and how they address specific problems."

### Location

This was my first undergraduate research project under [Prof. Satyadev Nandakumar](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/satyadev/), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur, which I took up concurrently with his course [CS 687 : Algorithmic Information Theory](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/satyadev/sp19/) in the Spring '19 term.
