### Location

This was a research project at EPFL's [MLO Lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/mlo/), mentored by [Prof. Martin Jaggi](https://people.epfl.ch/martin.jaggi) and [Prof. Aymeric Dieulevieut](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~aymeric.dieuleveut/) during my semester exchange at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in the fall of 2018.
