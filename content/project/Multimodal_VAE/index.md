title: "Video Generation using Multimodal VAE"
summary: "Performed a literature survey on generative models and video generation using
GANs/VAEs.
Designed and implemented a video generation model in PyTorch, based on the MVAE
model by Wu and Goodman, 2018. Proposed improvement of the model by replacing the MSE error with a GAN discriminator,
and training the model from end-to-end."

### Location

This was my second undergraduate research project under [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur, which I took up after completing his course [CS 783 : Visual Recognition](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/teaching/cs783/) in the Spring '19 term.
