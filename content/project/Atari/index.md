title: "Deep Reinforcement Learning for Atari Games"
summary: "Used Deep Reinforcement learning to learn models which can achieve super-human
performance on the popular game ‘Flappy bird’. Used DQN to accept raw pixels as input from a pygame simulation, and took actions
based on the output which estimated future rewards (Q-values for actions possible). Designed and implemented a policy-gradient version separately, and compared the
performance of the two methods."
