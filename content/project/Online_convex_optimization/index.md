title: "Online Constrained Convex Optimization using Mirror Descent"
summary: "Designed a No constraint violation algorithm with theoretical guarantees for sublinear dynamic regret for the Online Convex Optimization (OCO) problem after performing a thorough literature survey on the existing work in OCO. Extended the algorithm to the distributed setting by imposing an extended Slaterâ€™s condition to establish strong duality for feasible optimization."

### Location

This project started as part of my summer research internship at IITK's [SPiN Lab](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/spinlab/index.html) under [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/). Since then, we have designed two novel algorithms and are currently working on suitable experiments and writing the paper, which we hope to finish and submit soon.
