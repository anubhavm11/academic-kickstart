title: "Small variance asymptotics for non-parametric Bayesian clustering"
summary: "Studied recent attempts to reach a middle-ground (between performance and simplicity)
for large scale data, using small variance asymptotics, to get a non parametric
model which is scalable. Implemented the existing approaches to tackle the problem like Dirichlet Process Mixture
Models, and extended this algorithm to a hierarchical structure using Hierarchical
Dirichlet process. Generalized the clustering algorithm to use Bregman divergences. Used the models to perform clustering on the iris dataset, among others, while evaluating
the performance using standard (NMI) and custom validation techniques."
