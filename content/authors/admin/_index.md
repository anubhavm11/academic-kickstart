I am a senior undergraduate at [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/) majoring in Electrical Engineering with a second major in Computer Science. I am interested in solving problems in Machine Learning, Convex Optimization and Computer Vision.

Presently, I am a research assistant at IITK's [SPiN Lab](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/spinlab/index.html), working with [Prof. Ketan Rajawat](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~ketan/) on problems in online convex optimization. We are currently working on my first paper, which we plan to submit soon.

Prior to this, I have worked with [Prof. Satyadev Nandakumar](https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/satyadev/), where we focused on developing a principled intuition behind Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and its optimal implementations. I also had the chance to work with [Prof. Vinay P. Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/) and Ravindra Yadav on video generation using VAEs. In the summer of 2018, I was an intern in the Isolation Product Line of [Texas Instruments, India](http://www.ti.com/isolation/overview.html), working with [Koteshwar Rao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/koteshwarraoj/) to improve upon the design of TI's digital isolators.
